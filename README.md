# ðŸ§  BTC Volatility Modelling with GARCH-type Models

This project explores the volatility of Bitcoin using various GARCH-type models including:
- GARCH
- EGARCH
- GJR-GARCH

The goal is to assess the effectiveness of each model on historical BTC price data and identify volatility clustering patterns and forecasting performance.

## ðŸ§ª Models & Methodology
- **GARCH(1,1)**: Standard volatility modelling
- **EGARCH**: Captures asymmetric volatility effects
- **GJR-GARCH**: Models leverage effect

## ðŸ›  Technologies
- Python (NumPy, pandas, arch, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git/GitHub

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
Bitcoin daily price data from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Visualisation of fitted volatilities
- Comparison of AIC/BIC
- Forecast accuracy metrics
